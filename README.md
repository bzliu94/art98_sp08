<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_durant/3.png" title="view of front again, but with a hint of copper patina roof" width="200"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_durant/4.png" title="view from out of bounds" width="200">

A map consisting of a likeness of Durant Hall from UC Berkeley.

## de_durant_without_ladders

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_durant_without_ladders/1.png" title="view of front of Durant Hall with conspicuous lack of a ladder" width="200">

A map that also involves Durant Hall, but this time unmarred by ladders (since bots seem to be unable to climb ladders without editing .nav file manually, anyway).

## de_geode

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_geode/1.png" title="view of gauntlet" width="200"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_geode/2.png" title="view of gauntlet bomb site" width="200">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_geode/3.png" title="view of canopy" width="200"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_geode/4.png" title="view of canopy bomb site" width="200">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_geode/5.png" title="view from out of bounds" width="200">

A map that consists of a maze-like "gauntlet" room and a multi-layer "canopy" room. The theme is to do with crystals. A slick feature is that crystals in this map tend to glow.

## de_geode_skeleton

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_geode_skeleton/1.png" title="looking up at top bomb site" width="200"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_geode_skeleton/2.png" title="view down from top bomb site" width="200">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_geode_skeleton/3.png" title="view of top bomb-site from top" width="200"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_geode_skeleton/4.png" title="looking down at bottom bomb site" width="200">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_geode_skeleton/5.png" title="view from out of bounds" width="200">

A map that is predecessor of de_geode. It also has theme that is to do with crystals, but gameplay is considerably more biased towards one bomb site (i.e. the higher one).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_wurster/1.png" title="view of front of Wurster Hall" width="200"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_wurster/2.png" title="floating view of front" width="200">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_wurster/5.png" title="OOB view of rear" width="200"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_wurster/6.png" title="OOB view of left side" width="200">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzliu94/art98_sp08/master/selected_screenshots/de_wurster/7.png" title="view of a tree's special prop shadow" width="200">

A map consisting of a likeness of Wurster Hall from UC Berkeley. It's incomplete, because we lack enough information about all faces of the building.
